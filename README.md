# The Talus Bio Data Science Project Template

Keeping well organized data science projects is difficult, but important.
Ideally every project should be reproducible---that is, anyone starting from
the same data, code, and similar hardware should be able to obtain the same 
results. 

The goal of this template is to make our data science work at Talus
reproducible and approachable. Using this template ensures that we organize
code and data consistently across projects. This means when you join another
project that is organized using this template, you will immediately know the
lay of the land. 

This template uses [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter)
to create a directory structure for a repository that is consistent and
well-suited for data science projects. There are biases and assumptions in this
template: we assume that Python will be your primary tool (although it doesn't
have to be) and that some amount of modeling will be performed as part of the 
project (although there doesn't have to be). As such, this template is intended
to serve as a guideline rather than a rule and you should feel free to modify
it as needed for your specific project.

This template was adapted from the [The Cookiecutter Data Science
Project](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science) and Bill
Noble's ["A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology
Projects"](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424).
